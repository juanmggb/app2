# In a Django project, the .gitignore file is used to specify files and directories that should not be tracked by Git. It is common to include the following in the .gitignore file:

# __pycache__/: This directory is used by Python to store compiled bytecode files, which are not needed in the version control system.

# *.pyc: Python bytecode files that are generated when the source code is compiled.

# *.sqlite3: SQLite3 database file, in case if you are using SQLite as your database.

# *.log: Log files generated by the application.

# *.env: environment files that may contain sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, etc.

# media/ and static/: Directories used to store user-uploaded media files and static files respectively, which are typically served by the web server and don't need to be version controlled.

# .DS_Store: A file created on macOS systems that stores metadata about the directory, it is not necessary for the version control.

# .venv/: Virtual environment directory, it contains the dependencies of the project and could be recreated using requirements.txt.
